# How are Artists Affected by Spotify's Genre Classification? 

# *A Comparative Study between French and British Playlists Produced by Spotify*

## Introduction

On 5th June 2020, Republic Records, an entity within Universal Music Records, announced that they would ‘remove “urban” from the label’s verbiage in describing departments, employee titles and music genres’ (Aswad, 2020). This announcement came in the midst of a nation-wide conversation around systemic racism in the United States after the death of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Tyler. #TheShowMustBePaused and Blackout Tuesday movements notably demanded that the music industry take accountability for its disparate treatment of Black artists, by ‘protecting and empowering the black communities that have made them disproportionately wealthy in ways that are measurable and transparent’ (idem). Republic Records was the first of many actors within the American music ecosystem to adopt such a measure and was notably followed by the National Academy for Recording Arts and Sciences which organises the Grammy Awards. The National Academy decided to undertake a similar change and substitute the category ‘Best Urban Contemporary Album’' for ‘Best Progressive R&B Album’ (Lewis, 2020). This change was presented as a way to ‘appropriately categorize and describe this subgenre’ and ultimately use ‘a more accurate definition to describe the merit or characteristics of music compositions or performances themselves within the genre of R & B’' (idem).
\
\
This movement gained traction in France, as the French streaming platform Deezer decided to follow suit. Deezer’s justification was built on a rationale similar to that of the Grammys -- they saw the term urban as an outdated label that inadequately coalesces Black artists together, regardless of their music genres (Fanen, 2020). However, this decision was not as widely accepted in France as in the US. Many major stakeholders still use the term ‘urban’, including record labels and Spotify France. Notably, Spotify France has argued that the controversy around the ‘urban’ term is a mere ‘anglo-saxon debate’, which is not relevant to French society, as the ‘urban’ label adequately and accurately refers to the ‘music of the youth in urban areas’ (Cachin, 2020). This reflects the intrinsic difficulty to categorise and classify music. Musical genres are categories that are ever-evolving, reassessed and redefined, as artists innovate and experiment through genre-bending by mixing features associated with a specific genre, with features associated with another.
\
\
The debate in France is focused on the category ‘pop urbaine’ which is used to refer to hip hop, r&b, dancehall, afrotrap and ragga (Lemaître, 2020). Whilst some argue that pop urbaine is a relevant label -- referring to a musical melting pot incorporating diasporic sonorities (from North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa), the French local musical culture, and the US art form of hip hop (Cachin, 2020) -- others see this term as an abstract and stigmatising label which underscores a disparate treatment between aesthetics associated with artists of colour and those of white artists (Fanen, 2020). In other words, whilst advocates see this term as a legitimate music category, critics view this genre as an outdated catch-all term which reflects a lack of understanding of the evolution of the musical scene in France amongst young artists of colour.
\
\
Our study is thus guided by the question *How are artists affected by Spotify’s genre classification?*, looking specifically at the case of France. It aims to contribute to this debate by investigating the implications of the use of the label ‘urban’ by Spotify France and in its music recommendation algorithm. Our findings show that the use of such broad catch-all categories leads to an unnecessarily heightened competition between artists, making it harder for niche and independent artists to be recommended by the algorithm to users. This sets the pop urbaine genre apart from more specific genres on Spotify France, but also from countries in which Spotify has attempted to develop a more specific, comprehensive and fine-grained understanding of the local music scene. Ultimately, this phenomenon results in the promotion of a select few well-established artists, and prevents Spotify from enabling the listener to discover new artists. Most significantly, specific and precise labelling is imperative for the emergence and discovery of new, independent, and nicher artists, and allows for a proper understanding and account of the evolution of music amongst young artists of colour.


## Context

Spotify, currently the largest music streaming service in the world, is a Swedish start-up founded in 2016. The service bases its marketing strategy and its user experience heavily on the volume of user data and content data it collects. In this project, we focused on its genre-categorisation algorithms and recommendation algorithms. These two systems collaborate by first identifying certain characteristics of a track, an album, or an artist, and then, based on those identified characteristics, recommending the music to the targeted audience. Here, we focus on analysing the possible discrimination towards artists brought about by these two Spotify algorithms. Similar to most profit-driven companies, Spotify has not made its algorithm transparent and openly accessible. However, it does disclose certain compositions of its algorithms from various channels. From here we have noted that Spotify adopts content-based and user-history-based algorithms. 
\
\
Content-based algorithms categorise millions of tracks into scattered genres by examining features embedded within tracks and playlists. With content-based algorithms, Spotify has developed an Audio-Feature model with nine dimensions (Sree 2021), which are key, mode (major or minor), acousticness (a 0 to 1 measurement that indicates the confidence level in the acoustic nature of a track), danceability (a 0 to 1 measurement that indicates how suitable a track is for dancing), energy (a 0 to 1 measurement that indicates how fast, loud, and intense a track is), instrumentalness (a 0 to 1 measurement that indicates how instrumental a track is), loudness (measured in decibels), valence (a 0 to 1 measurement that indicates how positive a track sounds), tempo (measured in beats per minute), and popularity (a 0 to 100 measurement that indicates how popular a track is). Among these, there are dimensions that are originally measured numerically, while there are also dimensions that are transformed into numerical values. Thus, the fundamental rationale behind this Audio-Feature model is to systematically extract sensational and abstract features from music, and to convert them into quantified, standardised, and computational data. 
\
\
Although a collection of articles dedicated to analysing the relationship between the popularity of a song  and its Spotify Audio Features (Amsterdam 2019; Georgieva et al. 2018; Middlebrook & Sheik 2019) already exists, very few studies have attempted to examine whether the Spotify machine learning empowered Audio Features can accurately classify music in a manner that conforms to general human perception, and also respects nuances among highly diverse genres. Apart from Audio Features, Spotify also employs natural language processing (NLP) as a part of its content-based categorisation mechanism. Spotify’s NLP algorithms constantly extract word-based information on the Internet, including songs’ lyrics, descriptions, labels, people’s posts and comments, and reviews from industrial publications, and thus develop more and more enhanced predictions of how people understand music and genres (Krysik, 2020). 
\
\
Another component of Spotify’s algorithms on classification and recommendation system is based on user-history. People’s listening history, search history, playlists, etc, provide valuable information about their preferences, which enables Spotify to generate user-profiles of its audience and to thus recommend content tailored to their tastes (Pinarbasi, 2019; Melchiorre & Schedl 2020). More importantly, Spotify applies collaborative filtering to its user population, which compares a single user’s profile to a large group of people, and produces clusters of people with similar preferences (Pérez-Marcos & Batista 2018). Collaborative filtering studies existing behaviors and predicts future behaviors based on well-established group portraits. It thus improves its efficiency by moving from comparing similarities among music and individual users to comparing at a collective level (Johnson 2014). Introducing user-history based algorithms is an important step for matching the right music for the right ear. Holding such a large volume of content data and user data, Spotify employs the mechanism called matrix factorisation to map the presumed correlations among users and content. Recognising the fact that each user has accessed a limited amount of content and only a very limited amount of users have accessed a large enough amount of content, matrix factorisation aligns factors concerning users and those concerning platform’s content in a weighted manner, in order to generalise the known alignments within the matrix to the overall population (Huq, 2019).
\
\
Successfully predicting the genre of music and therefore introducing it to the targeted audience is crucial for Spotify and also for artists, since both parties gain revenue when a track is played by a single user. Therefore, being categorised “properly” means higher possibility of being discovered by the interested audience as well as the potential audience base, and if one’s works are selected into the representative playlist of a specific genre linked to Every Noise At Once -- a Spotify-affiliated musical genre exploration website that maps thousands of existing popular and niche genres (Patch 2016) -- it definitely brings the advantage of visibility, and therefore, popularity. Although Spotify has already developed such a sophisticated categorisation and recommendation system, whether the system can produce unbiased accurate predictions or not is still up for debate. One of the most salient issues is inherent in its Audio Features, which calculates the popularity of a track as a presumably objective value. Since popularity is brought into the consideration of promoting a track or not in the first place, already popular tracks and artists may enjoy an even higher level of exposure, which sits at the core of our inquiry. 

## Literature Review

The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has ‘led to a number of calls for “transparency”’ (Walmsley, 2021: 585) which is noted in multiple fields of AI such as translation algorithms, law enforcement, and more. Significantly, Floridi et al. (2018 in Walmsley, 2021: 587) describe the opacity of algorithms and their ‘machine bias’ in ‘socially significant’ contexts, which refers to a situation where individuals or groups are prejudiced by biases produced or exacerbated by AI, yet do not have any viable recourse due to the lack of transparency of the algorithm. Walmsley (2021) notes that on most occasions, machine bias problems are ‘identified and fixed with human intervention’ and thus it is critical that AI systems should be designed in a way that allows for ‘challenging or contesting automated decisions’ (588). Ultimately, this highlights a need for greater scrutiny of algorithms on which users ‘seem to preferentially trust and rely [...] to make predictions and decisions in a growing range of socially significant and morally weighty contexts’ (idem: 594).
\
\
One of these socially significant contexts is that of the music industry, in particular streaming platforms like Spotify. Though music recommendations and classification might not appear to be as ‘morally weighty’ as that of the use of algorithms in judicial proceedings or crime prediction as discussed in the literature (Walmsley, 2021), it nonetheless has a profound impact on artists’ livelihood -- especially independent artists and artists from minority groups (e.g. women) (Ferraro et al., 2021; Dominik et al., 2021; Shakespeare et al., 2020). Focussing on streaming platforms, Anderson et al. (2020: 1) found that ‘algorithmically-driven listening through recommendations is associated with reduced consumption diversity [and] that when users become more diverse in their listening over time, they do so by shifting away from algorithmic consumption and increasing their organic consumption’. This is unsurprising, considering the ‘curatorial power’ that digital platforms have in ‘inaugurat[ing] relations of dependency among creators and the industries they draw upon’ (Prey, 2020: 1). Platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify ‘do not produce -- or own -- most of the content they circulate’ (ibid) but they have the power to decide what and how to present the content on their platforms through the ‘organizing and programming of content’ (idem: 8). A particular feature that streaming platforms leverage are playlists, which Prey (2020) argues that Spotify uses to ‘gradually reduce its reliance on record labels by slowly increasing the percentage of directly licensed or unsigned content within [playlists]’ (8). Wielding its curatorial power, Spotify is able to unilaterally (re-)organise music produced by artists with or without their input:
\
\
    *‘As a result, Spotify has become a “new gatekeeper” (Bonini & Gandini, 2019) and a “very powerful intermediary” (quoted in Shah, 2018)’ (Prey, 2020: 7).*
\
\
However, Kamehkhosh et al. (2020) posit that ‘little is known so far about the effects of [playlist] recommendation functionality’, but found that the ‘mere presence of the recommendations impacts the choices of the participants, even in cases when none of the recommendations was actually chosen’ (285). They found that ‘track recommendations were highly adopted by [their] participants’ and ‘helped [them] discover relevant tracks and influenced their choices even when they did not select one of the recommendations’ (idem: 287). These findings suggest that playlists influence Spotify users, whether in an overt or subliminal way.
\
\
Within the realm of machine bias in streaming platforms, academics note that ‘gender fairness is one of [artists’] main concerns’ and the ostensible bias against independent labels, arguing that major labels are favoured (Ferraro et al., 2021: 249; see also Shakespeare et al., 2020; Dominik et al., 2021). In particular, Ferraro et al. (2021) argue that music recommendation systems ‘may privilege the content of a small group of artists when maximizing user satisfaction’, thereby ‘limits some artists’ chances to reach a larger audience particularly due to the feedback loop’ which refers to the algorithm learning to ‘recommend increasingly similar items’ (249). In the light of this potential bias, Shakespeare et al. (2020) cite ‘recent reports [of] the disproportionate treatment of female artists [...] prevalent in the Western music industry’ (1) but found in their study of gender bias in Spotify playlists that there is a bias both for and against female artists but no ‘relations between [that] and the disproportionate low streaming share of female artists on the platform’ (2). Instead, they conclude that ‘recommender systems can propagate a pre-existing bias’ but may not necessarily ‘cause the emergence of new forms of biases’, albeit cautioning that their study made use of data that ‘come mostly from Western countries [which] cannot be generalized to represent a global scenario’ (idem: 8).
\
\
Dominik et al.’s (2021) study, on the other hand, found that ‘current recommender systems do not work well for consumers of beyond-mainstream music’ and are particularly ‘prone to popularity bias, which leads to the behavior that long-tail items (i.e., items with fewer user interactions) have little chance of being recommended’ (1-2). This implies that artists that produce music perceived to be non-mainstream would find it more difficult to be recommended to listeners compared to their mainstream counterparts. They conclude their study ‘validat[ing] related research by showing that beyond-mainstream music listeners receive a significantly lower recommendation accuracy than mainstream music listeners by four standard recommendation algorithms’ (idem: 22). This not only disadvantages non-mainstream listeners on Spotify but also the artists themselves who are unable to reach their target audience. On the surface, recommendation systems are supposed to help users ‘discover new products’, however, it might in practice ‘lead to a reduction in sales diversity’ and ‘prevent what may otherwise be better consumer-product matches’ (Fleder & Hosanagar, 2009: 697).
\
\
Given that ‘recommender systems have become an essential means to help users deal with content and choice overload as they assist users in searching, sorting, and filtering these extensive music collections’ (Dominik et al., 2021: 1) and that ‘playlisting algorithms tend to privilege certain genres over others’, the workings and effects of music recommendation systems ‘represent a serious social justice concern’ (Chodos, 2019: 39) that requires closer scrutiny.


## Methdology

![Methodology Flowchart](/../main/spotify@1.5x.png)

### Playlists considered: Pop Urbaine, Who We Be, GrandHit

Since the starting point of our project was the broad genre of Pop Urbaine, we considered the Spotify created Pop Urbaine playlist as our primary dataset, which claims to include “all pop urbaine and afropop hits”. To allow a comparison between two similar playlists, we included Who We Be, the UK’s biggest “Hip-Hop, Afrobeats, Dancehall and RnB playlist”.  Since we wanted to explore the intersection between hip hop and French music, the comparison with Who We Be allowed us to study this across language and geographical region. However, these two playlists did not account for variances that might arise from English music in Spotify being better categorised. This is why we also included GrandHit, a playlist that contains the 50 most popular *French* hits of the moment. By using GrandHit as a comparison with Pop Urbaine, we were able to clarify whether the issue lay with categorisation of French music or specifically Pop Urbaine. 

### Process followed

We have represented our methodology in the flowchart presented. To collect the data we either used the Spotipy API to generate dataframes of playlists or used the website OrganizeYourMusic to generate tables that we formatted into excel sheets to later import into our notebook. Most of our analysis was done using Python and the Pandas library, and some of the data visualisation was done using Data Wrapper.  We decided to analyse three types of datasets from these playlists. First, we looked at the frequency of artists within playlists. Second, we looked at the frequency of genres and subgenres within the playlists. Finally, we considered the frequency of artists and their popularity from the radios of random artists associated with the three main playlists. These steps are better explained in the notebook, especially with regards to the code used and the specific dataset referred to. The logic underlying our analysis was **counting and creating visualisations to show frequency and variance**.
