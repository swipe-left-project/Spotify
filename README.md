## Playlists considered: Pop Urbaine, Who We Be, GrandHit

Since the starting point of our project was the broad genre of Pop Urbaine, we considered the Spotify created Pop Urbaine playlist as our primary dataset, which claims to include “all pop urbaine and afropop hits”. To allow a comparison between two similar playlists, we included Who We Be, the UK’s biggest “Hip-Hop, Afrobeats, Dancehall and RnB playlist”.  Since we wanted to explore the intersection between hip hop and French music, the comparison with Who We Be allowed us to study this across language and geographical region. However, these two playlists did not account for variances that might arise from English music in Spotify being better categorised. This is why we also included GrandHit, a playlist that contains the 50 most popular French hits of the moment. By using GrandHit as a comparison with Pop Urbaine, we were able to clarify whether the issue lay with categorisation of French music or specifically Pop Urbaine. 

## Process followed:

We have represented our methodology in the flowchart presented and we will explain it here briefly for further clarification. To collect the data we either used the Spotipy API to generate dataframes of playlists or used the website OrganizeYourMusic to generate tables that we formatted into excel sheets to later import into our notebook. Most of our analysis was done using Python and the Pandas library, and some of the data visualisation was done using Data Wrapper.  We decided to analyse three types of datasets from these playlists. First, we looked at the frequency of artists within playlists. Second, we looked at the frequency of genres and subgenres within the playlists. Finally, we considered the frequency of artists and their popularity from the radios of random artists associated with the three main playlists. These steps are better explained in the notebook, especially with regards to the code used and the specific dataset referred to. The logic underlying our analysis was counting and creating visualisations to show frequency and variance. 

# Analysis

All of our analysis is conducted in the following notebook: [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w99D_v5jLEBoDnfZvAtqSLsCKjXunA2l?usp=sharing)
The link above gives you the ability to comment on the notebook. The datasheets required to run the code have also been uploaded to this respository.
